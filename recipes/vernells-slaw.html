<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wonderful slaw recipe passed down from my Grandmother's cook, Vernell. It's similar to a sweet and sour cabbage recipe, and will keep for 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Great served with beef brisket. Best made a day or more before serving.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 large head cabbage, cored and shredded</li>
  <li>Â¾ cup white sugar, divided</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 cup white vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon celery seed</li>
  <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place the shredded cabbage into a large glass baking dish or other glass dish. Do not use metal or plastic. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of white sugar and the salt.</li>
  <li>In a separate microwave safe bowl, combine the remaining sugar, oil, vinegar, mustard, celery seed and pepper. Stir to blend in the sugar, then heat until boiling in the microwave, about 3 minutes. Immediately, but carefully pour the boiling mixture over the cabbage. Toss with a wooden or plastic utensil to evenly coat the cabbage.</li>
  <li>Let stand out on the counter for several hours, stirring occasionally. Cover and refrigerate. Toss before serving, and serve with a slotted spoon.</li>
